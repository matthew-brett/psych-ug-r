The R and data analysis part of the course has [one
assessment](../assignments/288350 "Coding Assessment") at the end.

The assessment is an R notebook for you to fill in.  It's open-book, you can
search for answers on the web, but of course you can't share work with other
students doing the assessment - it must all be your own work.  We'll give you
several days to fill in the notebook.

As you will see in the workshops, [R
notebooks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html) are documents
that mix text, such as descriptions of what the data means, and the processing
you want to do, with short fragments of code, called chunks.

The assignments are documents like these, that contain instructions about what
to do, and some template code chunks for you to complete, to do the analysis.

You'll get a fair amount of practice on these in the workshops.
